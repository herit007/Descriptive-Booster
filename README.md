# Descriptive-Booster

This project is a practical implementation of Descriptive Statistics using a household dataset that includes variables such as Age, Household Income, Family Size, Education Level, and Area (Urban/Rural). The main objective was to analyze the dataset and understand the distribution, variation, and relationships between different variables.

In this project, measures like mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation were calculated to summarize and study the spread of the data. Skewness and kurtosis were also analyzed to understand the shape of the distribution. Various visualizations such as histograms, KDE plots, boxplots, and scatter plots with regression lines were created to interpret patterns and relationships, especially between age and income.

The analysis indicates a slight positive skewness in income distribution and a mild positive relationship between age and income. Overall, this project demonstrates how descriptive statistical techniques help transform raw data into meaningful insights for further analysis.
